# Type Tutor - A Pokémon Type Matchup App

This is a Next.js application built in Firebase Studio that helps users learn and master Pokémon type matchups.

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Features

- **Type Effectiveness:** Select a Pokémon type to see what it's super effective, not very effective, and has no effect against.
- **Resistances & Weaknesses:** View the defensive profile of each type, including what it resists, is weak to, and is immune to.
- **AI-Powered Explanations:** Get memorable analogies for any type matchup to help you learn faster.
- **Spaced Repetition Quiz:** A quiz that adapts to your knowledge level, focusing on matchups you struggle with.
- **Master Quiz:** A challenging quiz featuring dual-type matchups.

## How to Set Up on GitHub

The instructions below are for using Git, a version control system, to upload your code to GitHub. You'll need to run these commands in your computer's command line or terminal (not in Firebase Studio) from the directory where your project files are saved.

1.  **Create a new repository** on GitHub named `typetutor`. You can do that here: [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new).
2.  **Initialize Git** in your project folder:
    ```bash
    git init
    git branch -M main
    ```
3.  **Add your new repository as the "origin":**
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/apolyth/typetutor.git
    ```
4.  **Add, commit, and push your files:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push -u origin main
    ```
