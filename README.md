- **Resistances & Weaknesses:** View the defensive profile of each type, including what it resists, is weak to, and is immune to.
- **AI-Powered Explanations:** Get memorable analogies for any type matchup to help you learn faster.
- **Spaced Repetition Quiz:** A quiz that adapts to your knowledge level, focusing on matchups you struggle with.
- **Master Quiz:** A challenging quiz featuring dual-type matchups.
